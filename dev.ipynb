        "## Introduction\n",
        "This notebook is to track progress on this personal project I am interested in, related to a peculiar similarity I think I may have noticed between 2 seemingly disparate worlds: $\\textbf{Deep Learning}$ and $\\textbf{Supersymmetry}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "In particular, I have noticed fairly recently (within the last ~1 month) that the work being done in interpretibility over the last 3 - 4 years, like what is being done at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research), particularly the work being done by [Chris Olah](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6dskOSUAAAAJ&hl=en) on [Transformer Circuits](https://transformer-circuits.pub/) bears a striking similarity to the work [I have been a part of](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02971) as part of my experience with the research group out of Brown led by [Dr. Sylvester James Gates (Jim)](https://twitter.com/dr_jimgates).\n",
        "\n",
        "More specifically, I have caught on to a surprising thread (at least it is surprsising to me) that could suggest that the mathematics of supersymmetry and more generally quantum field theory could be applied directly to transformer-based neural networks (or perhaps neural networks in general) in order to both gain deeper insight into the mechanics of how a trained model is able to exhibit all of the emergent properties that we are observing as these models get larger, as well as to help more explicitly guide these models towards being truly aligned with human interests and priorities through some of the ablation/masking techniques studied in some of the works linked above.\n",
        "\n",
        "I will expand more deeply on this connection later in this document, but for now I think it is more imperative to get a better sense of what the current formalism looks like for this emerging field of *mechanistic interpretibility*, so let's get started..."

        "s = \"The 1899 Kentucky gubernatorial election was held on November 7, 1899. The Republican incumbent, William Bradley, was term-limited. The Democrats chose William Goebel. Republicans nominated William Taylor. Taylor won by a vote of 193,714 to 191,331. The vote was challenged on grounds of voter fraud, but the Board of Elections, though stocked with pro-Goebel members, certified the result. Democratic legislators began investigations, but before their committee could report, Goebel was shot by an unknown assassin (event pictured) on January 30, 1900. Democrats voided enough votes to swing the election to Goebel, Taylor was deposed, and Goebel was sworn into office on January 31. He died on February 3. The lieutenant governor of Kentucky, J. C. W. Beckham, became governor, and battled Taylor in court. Beckham won on appeal, and Taylor fled to Indiana, fearing arrest as an accomplice. The only persons convicted in connection with the killing were later pardoned; the assassin's identity remains a mystery\"\n",
